###### I decided to start to learn coding during this pandemic, this motivated me to add some COVID-19 related analysis to my repository. My report compares confirmed cases in Azerbaijan to same numbers in Houston, TX, US; also Chicago, IL to Los Angeles, CA. Then I showed the numbers for NY and finally numbers layered to US map.
