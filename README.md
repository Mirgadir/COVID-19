###### I decided to start to learn coding during COVID-19 lockout, 
###### This motivated me to add some COVID-19 related analysis to my repository. 
###### My report compares confirmed cases in Azerbaijan to same numbers in Houston, TX, US; also Chicago, IL to Los Angeles, CA. 
###### Then I showed the numbers for NY and finally numbers layered to US map.
